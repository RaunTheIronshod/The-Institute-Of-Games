Intro
------
This website is a demonstrable Javascript project in games engine coding by Berren Stonechild and Chanel Clarke. The project's scope is to produce two arcade games as portfolio work that will be deployed onto a webpage through Github's pages feature.

User Stories
--------
The user stories were produced to aid with the coding design of the games and websites main page. They were tailored toward gameplay and basic user page navigation as game production within javascript was the main focus, the overall page layout would be minimalistic

UX Design
--------
The design of the Institute of Games website is grounded in intuitive and interactive UX principles. Clear hover effects provide immediate visual feedback, signalling which elements are clickable, particularly on buttons and game cards, enhancing user confidence and engagement. The site’s layout follows a reveal-based interaction pattern, encouraging users to scroll to discover more content rather than overwhelming them all at once. This progressive reveal approach encourages curiosity.
The platform floor is fixed in position at the bottom of the viewport, creating a visual anchor that remains consistent as users scroll, while new content layers appear above it, reinforcing a sense of depth and continuity within the “space” theme. Navigation is straightforward and intuitive, with a persistent silver navbar containing internal links to the Home, Games, and About sections. This allows users to jump seamlessly between panels while maintaining orientation within the one-page layout.


Features
--------
Lazer Fighter
--------
Lazer fighter is a baseline project that is intended for future production, producing a game slice focused on player movement and basic side view shooter mechanics. 

The game features a wave system for enemy spawning as well as multiple enemy types, player powerup system with a variety of powerups, a player health and combat system in the form of projectiles, and a score and high score feature

Space Invaders
----------
This game challenges players to defend the galaxy by controlling a spaceship at the bottom of the screen and shooting waves of descending alien invaders. As players progress, the enemies move in larger waves, keeping the gameplay engaging and challenging. Points are awarded for each wave of invaders destroyed and 10 lives being the maximum total, encouraging high scores and replayability. Smooth controls and responsive firing using simple animation frames provide visual feedback and highlight successful hits. The game’s classic pixel-style graphics and retro aesthetic capture the nostalgic arcade feel, offering a fun and immersive experience for players of all skill levels.

Deployment
--------
The game is deployed using GitHub’s Pages feature, which allows the project to be hosted directly from the repository. The build files are stored in the main branch, and GitHub automatically serves them as a live webpage. This makes it easy to share and test the game online without requiring a separate server setup. Any updates pushed to the branch are instantly reflected on the hosted version.

AI Implementation
------------
Lazer Fighter
-----------
The use of AI in this product is mainly to aid with feature implementation and code cleanup, lengthy elements of code review and block context implementation using Windsurf for in-IDE implementation and chatGPT for more complex development. Consistent re-writes where required to avoid bad code practices and poor structure, though even with this fact the production speed was undeniably faster in the long run

Windsurf initially produced messy code and required some amount of prompting with technical specifics to produce something closer to industry standard, it had a habit of ignoring the text bulk and trying to solve the problem with a single method or function, contrastingly chatGPT was able to absorb the entire filecode and analyse it before responding, though it habitually forgot what it was trying to do when another prompt was passed, it would show slight deviation in naming conventions which required cleanup. 

Space Invaders
------------
Space Invaders does not incorporate AI gameplay; all enemy movement and actions are scripted. The only use of simple AI-like logic was during debugging to test collision detection and wave progression, ensuring the game mechanics functioned as intended. No adaptive or intelligent behaviour was implemented for the player or enemies.

Main Page
-------
The main website includes AI (ChatGPT) improvements that were applied to enhance user experience. This includes hover animations with neon shadows, pulse animation and keyframes that respond to user interaction, adaptive content layout for responsive design. These changes expanded the original concept, making the site more dynamic and engaging while maintaining intuitive navigation and aesthetic consistency.
